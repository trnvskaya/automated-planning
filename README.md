# Automated Planning (PDDL)

## Overview

This project defines and solves a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language). The goal is to find a sequence of moves that allows agents to reach their designated goal positions in a graph while avoiding conflicts.

## Project Structure

`mapf.pddl` – Defines the domain, including agent movement rules.

`mapf-problem.pddl` – Defines a specific MAPF problem instance with agents, vertices, and initial/goal states.

`plan.txt` – The generated plan solving the problem.
